    "# Fingerprints\n",
    "The substructure keys we used in the last exercise are nice, but they are not without limitations. The main issue with them is that we have to manually define a set of substructures to observe. Not only it is a lot of work, but it also inherently reflects our own biases in feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is not to observe a given list of substructures, but go one layer of abstraction higher and observe all structural features of a defined type. For example, we can observe all atoms in the characterized molecule, their types, and how far they are in relation with each other. Alternatively, we can also observe the surroundings of each atom within the characterized molecule, up to 2 or 3 bonds distance. This is the basis of the ever-popular circular fingerprints (i.e. a \"circle\" with radius of 2 or 3 bonds around every atom), most notably the Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). More information on ECFP fingerprints and their uses is in [ChemAxon docs](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/Extended+Connectivity+Fingerprint+ECFP) and [Daylight docs](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html).\n",

    "![ECFP_generation](../data/pix/ecfp_generation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can probably imagine, the amount of the observed features in such fingerprints is going to be very large. Combinatorially speaking, there are very many possible substructures of 4 to 6 bonds across, and every molecule is going to contain only a very small subset of those. The large number of observed features can be put into a more manageable size by using a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), that maps the large number of features into a binary vector of manageable length (commonly 512, 1024, 2048, sometimes 4096 bits). After hashing, every feature gets assigned a bit in the fingerprint. Since there are many orders of magnitude more features than available bits, many different features can map onto a single bit. The presence of one or more of these features will flip it to True - a \"bit collision\" in hashing. This is not that much of a problem in practice, as individual molecules do not have all that many features to hash. More observed features and shorter bit vector lenghts will incur higher collision rate, and vice versa. For ECFP radius 2 and 3, very common fingerprint type, bit sizes of 1024 and 2048 tend to work ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ECFP_hashing](../data/pix/ecfp_folding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, you do not have to do every described step of fingerprint generation, as fingerprints are already implemented in cheminformatic libraries and tools, RDKit included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to hashing, if you want to retrospectively know what exact features correspond to a specific bit you are interested in, you will have to re-run the fingerprint generation for your set of molecules. We will try that too in this exercise :)"

    "# What to do\n",
    " - Familiarize yourself with hashed fingerprints, again if you haven't already :) On top of lecture materials, good resources are the [ChemAxon docs](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/Extended+Connectivity+Fingerprint+ECFP) and [Daylight docs](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html). Some additional information on fingerprint designing and hashing is in the \"hashed fingerprint\" section of the [ChemAxon docs](https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/Chemical_Hashed_Fingerprint.html). A very good overview is in Greg Landrum's [London RDKit UGM presentation](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf).\n",
    " - Characterize your ligand set using ECFP type of fingerprints, preferably radius 2, size 1024.\n",
    " - Characterize the DrugBank database using the same fingerprint type\n",
    " - Identify in which ECFP bits does your ligand set differ from the DrugBank contents\n",
    " - Try to identify the structural fragments that set those most differing bits in your ligand set compared to DrugBank\n",
    " - Any thoughts/comments on the fragments that appear significantly more or less in your ligand set compared to DrugBank?"

    "So, in DrugBank, the fragment present most often behind this bit is 'ccc', i.e. 3 aromatic carbons, ncN, cnc, ccC and many other fragments, in relatively small amounts. The most frequent fragments in DrugBank mapping to 378 seem mostly related to rings, often aromatic/heterocyclic. In comparison, the most frequent fragments mapping to 378 seem to be COc, CCC, CCc, CNC, CCN, COC, etc. Those most common in DrugBank also appear there, but are comparatively less prominent. Therefore, the higher prevalence of bit 378 in MTOR ligands may be at least partially caused by higher amount of these aliphatic, or at least non-aromatic fragments amongst MTOR ligands."
